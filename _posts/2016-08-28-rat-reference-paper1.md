### 题记

原来的方法没有效果的时候,就需要换一种努力的方式. ---Mr.U

#### 2000 tests of the mouse visual system

> To apply the approach of forward genetics(e.g. gene identification with mutagenesis and screening, followed by postional cloning) to the mouse, it is necessary to have available screening tests that can be applied rapidly to individual mice and that give a reliable assessment of visual fuction. 

> This paper reviews the strengths and limitations of two anatomical tests related to visual fuction, fundus examination and retinal histological examination.

appropriate/suitable 代替proper

automated 而自己常常想到的是automatic或者automatically， “自动化，自动操纵的”这个意思的表达当然，前者更准确
